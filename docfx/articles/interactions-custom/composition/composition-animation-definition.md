# CompositionAnimationDefinition

`CompositionAnimationDefinition` is an internal helper class used to define the parameters of a composition animation, such as keyframes for offset, scale, opacity, and rotation, as well as initial values and anchor points.

It is used by the various animation helper classes (e.g., `EntranceAnimations`, `AttentionAnimations`) to construct animations.

> **Note:** This class is internal and not intended for direct use by consumers of the library.
